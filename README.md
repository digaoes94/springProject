This project got me started with Spring Boot, JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, HTTP exceptions and, mainly, Software Architecture. I knew Spring Boot existed, but never looked up for what it really is.
While I'm used to Eclipse because of my undergraduation, now I see that Spring is a tool that embraces several dependency needs, where it automates a lot of the developer's worries.
I still haven't learned about database at the college, now I have a foot ahead. I understand better CRUD and Factory, as well as requests to a server.
Anyway, still got a long road ahead!
